**Effective date:** February 8, 2026

JustLog ("we", "the service") respects your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect and how we use it.

## What We Collect

- **Account info:** Your email address, and optionally your name and profile picture (if you sign in with Google), used to identify your account.
- **Profile data:** Height, ideal weight, diet preferences, goals, lifestyle, and timezone — provided by you to personalize the experience.
- **Logged entries:** Food, exercise, and weight entries you create through the service or via AI assistants.
- **API keys:** Hashed keys for authenticating your sessions and integrations.

## What We Don't Collect

- We do not use analytics or tracking scripts.
- We do not use cookies (authentication is token-based).
- We do not collect device fingerprints or IP addresses for tracking purposes.

## How We Use Your Data

Your data is used solely to provide the JustLog service to you — displaying your dashboard, powering AI assistant integrations, and calculating your stats.

## Third Parties

- **AWS:** Our infrastructure runs on Amazon Web Services (DynamoDB, Lambda, S3, CloudFront, Cognito).
- **Google:** Optionally used for sign-in. If you sign in with Google, we receive your name, email, and profile picture.
- **AI Assistants:** When you connect an AI assistant via MCP, it can read and write your entries. You control which assistants have access through your API keys.

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with any other third parties.

## Data Retention

Your data is retained as long as your account exists. You may request deletion by contacting us.

## Security

Data is encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest (AWS encryption). API keys are stored as irreversible hashes.

## Changes

We may update this policy at any time. Continued use of the service constitutes acceptance.
